A Culturally Responsive Instructional Approach to Understand Blackbody Radiation

A mobile app and desktop app have been developed based on the CIE color-matching functions, which converts a spectrum of wavelengths into its RGB representation that describes the color. To put it simply, it displays a range of wavelengths as colors. This App shows the color of a black body at a given temperature, followed by an excellent illustration of the color rendering of spectra. Planck's function calculates the spectral radiance of a black body.

With spectral radiance as the spectrum, one will get the RGB components corresponding to the color of a black body at temperature T. Additionally; the app can determine the temperature assigned to a pixel's color selected for an image. The program was developed using Python 3 and Kivy. An executable version can be downloaded here.

Please note the following with the format of the images to be explored. Image resolution less than 800 x 600 pixels and PNG format. In the example directory, you can find some test images. Currently, only a compiled version is available to be used in the Windows 10 operating system and later.
